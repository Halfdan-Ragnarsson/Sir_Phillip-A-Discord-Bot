**Hazard Website**
*I.What is this:*

This is a website that hosts a simulation of the Medieval Game Hazard. Currently, there are three tabs. One for the simulation, one for the history, and one more for a live leaderboard. It is to be hosted on a local server such that a discord bot can share it in a server.
